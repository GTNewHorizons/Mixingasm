# The classes listed in this file will get added to the mixin environment's
# transformer exclusion list, avoiding running them an additional time when
# processing mixins.

# This fixes crashes caused by transformers that make unsafe assumptions which
# don't hold with Mixin, for example wrongly assuming they will only get run
# once.

# Delete this file to generate one with the newest defaults.
